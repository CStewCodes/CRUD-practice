# CRUD-practice
This is to practice creating CRUD Commands

GET
POST
PATCH
DELETE

### Ideas for practice

Movie list,
YT list
Playlist
To-Do List

Movie list--
- id
- movie name
- released date
- run time
- rating

### STATUS UPDATE
I got the movies list (CRUD) to work, now I just need to map the front end to the back end.

I'm stuck on the Search GET request. I'm too tired to work on it right now.

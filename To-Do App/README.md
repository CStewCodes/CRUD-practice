This app is going to be a ToDo app that basically starts with an field input and then a button that says "save task"
When the button is clicked, then it shows the task under the text input field.
Then there will be a button next to that-- "Done" that when clicked, it will be moved to a new database.



### Databases
1. To Do 
2. Completed
